# TheLastAirBender
Avatar-The Last Airbender game for iOS devices. Developed using Swift 5.

MAP523 - Mobile App Development - iOS (Summer 2019)

Final Project. Works perfectly. Got 28/30.
Please read the proposal I submitted.

The game is very 2D (partly 3D) but too broad for a first-time Swifter.
Think of something you would like to see Levitating.
I like animes, so I thought of Avatar or Naruto. Naruto's too complex and we only have 5 weeks to finish the project.

PS: The professor knows my project very well, so please don't copy! Also, you won't be able to win in the first run!
